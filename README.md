# Sanguihedral

Sanguihedral is intended to be a sect-agnostic dice and character sheet app for Vampire the Masquerade v5. This app is designed and built for two purposes:


- Firstly, it is intended to be my final project for my studies as a TripleTen Full-Stack Software Engineer student

- Second, it was requested by my local LARP group because our preferred dice rolling app is no longer available for iOS users and we needed a replacement
